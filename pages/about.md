## About the Collection

These stereo cards were acquired by the Brock University Archives in February 2021.  Understanding the research interests of the Brock faculty and students as well as those of the Niagara community, we wanted to be sure that these would remain publicly available into the future.

There are three photographers represented here:
1. Edwin Poole
2. G.F. Maitland
3. Mr. & Mrs. Miller

Poole and Maitland are well known St. Catharines photographers from this time. The Millers remain a bit of a mystery.  We know that they were in operation from 1865 to 1870 and that is about it.  Mr. Miller's first name might have been Chauncey.  There is more research that needs to be done.  But his image here of downtown St. Catharines looking Southwest from the steeple of St. George's Church would be the oldest photo in this collection.
